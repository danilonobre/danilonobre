## Problem Statement

<p class="text">Bleez E-commerce is a SaaS platform that provides e-commerce solutions for businesses. However, the market has a low understanding of how e-commerce works, making it difficult to sell the platform. The challenge is to educate potential customers about the benefits of e-commerce and how the Bleez platform can help them grow their business.</p>

## Research

<p class="text">We have started following two primary personas; the first one is small business owners with limited e-commerce knowledge and no online presence. The second persona is medium-sized businesses who have some experience in e-commerce and want to scale their operations. But, to understand our target audience better, we conducted customer interviews and pitch tests. We found out that our audience could be divided into seven personas based on their e-commerce maturity.</p>

## Conversion

<p class="text">To attract more qualified leads, we aligned our marketing strategies with UX metrics and A/B tests. We implemented several inbound marketing techniques, such as SEO optimization, content marketing, and social media marketing, to drive more traffic to our website. We also improved our UX by making it more intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing. We conducted A/B tests to identify the most effective conversion strategies and optimize our funnel.</p>

## Final Phase

We track user behavior, conduct user testing, and analyze user feedback to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement. We also stay up to date with the latest e-commerce trends and technologies to ensure that our platform stays ahead of the curve. As a result, we continue to refine our platform, making it more user-friendly and beneficial to our customers.</p>
