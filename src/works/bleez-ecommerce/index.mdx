aboutcompany: SundaySky works with the world's leading brands to create personalized, data-driven videos for their customers. They approached Theorem to design a streamlined dashboard experience for viewing their SmartVideo content, analyzing metrics, and educating customers.
project: As the product manager and lead designer on the project, I worked closely with SundaySky stakeholders and users to define goals and validate concepts. The timeline for the project was only three months, so working with a lean UX approach was crucial. I collaborated with SundaySky's development team to implement my designs and provided design QA support up until the launch of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
