## Problem

<p>Since the biggest part of the local market doesn't understand how an e-commerce works, technically, was very difficult to explain that Bleez only act with the platform. In other words, Bleez only sells the system they need to display their products and capture a sale.</p>

## The journey

<p>At this point i got a lot of advantage of my work as a designer, because I had direct and constant contact with the customers and through customer i got easy access to end-users to use in research. This allowed me to fastly get answers to the questions the team has, to after this design experiments and test them even faster.</p>

## Planning

<p>
I love to begin my plannings with journay maps or mind maps, that's the easy and quickly way to organize my thoughts and even easier to explain to team. To organize the tasks and projects I use Notion app, with its flexibility I can do whataver I want to have an simple and fast view of the project and tasks, and pass this to the team.

## Personas

<p>
Create the personas was one of the most challenging missions. Before this moment we were under a perspective where our personas are organized by their business model, and only after some insights that we realized that our personas needed to be created by their e-commerce maturity. Remember our problem about the difficult the market had to understand e-commerce? So, after that my pitch sales was molded by this maturity level, which leds us to 7 (Yes, SEVEN! ðŸ˜…) personas.
<br />
The amazing part of this work was to see that these personas was allocated in all stages of the Bleez business model, not only thinking in achieving new clients, but the actual clients was represented too, so the product team also started to consume their related personas.
<br />
I always like to bring fun things to my work, so I decided to create the personas based on pop culture characters, trying to link their behavior with a related character that, someway, acts similarly.
</p>

<p>
For example, I created John Locke, a character from LOST!, a Tv serie. This character is a faithful man, he believes so much in something from the show that this believe moves him even when he hadn't any sure about all of that, and this is very like one of our personas, they don't understand exactly how an e-commerce works, but even without this understanding they believe that will be successful, so only with this believe they start the journey.
<br />
Another one was Rocky Balboa, a persona created thinking in Rocky, yes, that one, a character that knows that it ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, and I saw that we had clients that are more like a John Locke but with their e-commerce evolving they are starting to become more like Rocky, got it?

## Experiments

<p>
In this project I worked with the holy trinity of ux metrics, Google Analytics to get numbers, Smartlook to watch users during the experience and Heatmap.com to get heat maps, and with all of these data in hand we've created experiments to test, to in 15 days we digest the resuts and iterate about each one.

## The Neverending Story

<p>
From here we start a new chapter of the same journey, always looking for metrics to understand what worked as planned (or not), gathering the team to work together, talking with prospects and customers and doing a lot of experiments, until we meet here again...
