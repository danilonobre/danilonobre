## Problem

<p class="text">The challenge here is to improve the user experience of our platform to streamline the insurance claim process and increase customer satisfaction.</p>

## Research

<p class="text">To understand our users' needs better, we conducted user research through surveys and interviews with our existing customers. We found out that our customers were experiencing difficulties with the insurance claim process, which was causing delays and frustrations.</p>

## Design

<p class="text">To improve the user experience of our platform, we redesigned our website with a focus on user-friendliness and clarity. We made it easy for our users to access information about our insurance policy and the claim process. We also created a simple and intuitive form that our users could use to submit a claim.</p>
<p class="text">We added a tracking feature to our platform to help logistics managers track the progress of their claims in real-time. This feature allowed them to identify potential issues and address them promptly, reducing delays and frustrations. For customers, we added a chatbot feature that allowed them to ask questions and receive immediate assistance from our support team.</p>
